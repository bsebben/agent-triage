# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.34.2] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Tickets tab: filter bar with a Backlog toggle; backlog items are hidden by default and the button shows the hidden count

### Fixed

- Tickets tab: cursor-based pagination now fetches all pages correctly by using smaller page sizes to avoid mcpproxy truncation

## [1.34.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Drawer action buttons show "(dangerously)" label when shift is held

## [1.34.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Pull Requests and Tickets tabs: a "Workspace limit reached" banner now appears at the top when the cmux workspace limit is hit, and the per-row action button is disabled (with a tooltip) since every action opens a new workspace.

### Changed

- Renamed "session limit reached" to "workspace limit reached" everywhere (API errors, banners, toasts) — the limit counts cmux workspaces, including terminal sessions.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Pull Requests tab: "Fix CI" action button in the drawer. Checks out the PR branch and runs `/ci fix` to investigate and fix failing CI, with a manual fallback if the skill isn't installed.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Tickets tab: Runlayer MCP fallback transport. When `mcpproxy` is unavailable, the dashboard can connect directly to a Runlayer-hosted Jira MCP server via HTTP. Configure `runlayerUrl` and `runlayerApiKey` under `tabs.tickets` in `config.json`, or set the `RUNLAYER_USER_KEY` env var.
- New `src/runlayer-mcp.js` module: lightweight MCP client for Runlayer Streamable HTTP servers, handling the initialize/initialized handshake and session management.
- Transport auto-detection: the tickets tab now tries mcpproxy first, then Runlayer, with clear hint messages for each failure mode.
- Friendly error messages for Runlayer auth issues (401/403) guiding users to the correct API key type.

## [1.31.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Shift-click danger mode for action drawer: hold Shift when clicking PR or ticket actions to spawn the Claude session with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Buttons turn red while Shift is held, matching the existing workspace tab behavior.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Tasks tab: persistent task list with REST API (`GET/POST /api/tasks`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/tasks/:id`). Tasks survive server restarts via `data/tasks.json`. Configurable expiry via `maxAgeDays` and `expireBehavior` (`hide`/`delete`). Disabled by default.
- Tasks tab frontend: checklist UI with inline add input, checkbox toggle (strikethrough for done items), hover-reveal delete button, and badge showing count of incomplete tasks.
- `triage-tasks` Claude skill: manage the task list programmatically from any Claude Code session. Installed automatically by `bin/install.sh`.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Bypass permissions indicator: workspace cards now show a red left border when a Claude Code session is running with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Detected live via process inspection each poll cycle, so the indicator updates if a session is restarted with different flags.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Tickets tab story/epic groups are now collapsible — click a group header to expand or collapse its tickets. Click the parent key chip to open it in Jira.

### Changed

- Tickets and Pull Requests tabs now render each group as a soft card — a colored left accent rail plus a subtle background tint and rounded edge — making it clearer which items belong to which story/epic or repo.
- Group headers on the Tickets and Pull Requests tabs are slightly larger with a small gap above their rows; on the Tickets tab the story summary truncates and the key chip stays pinned to the right.
- Removed the per-group column-header rows (Ticket/Status, PR/Status/CI) from the Tickets and Pull Requests tabs for a cleaner look.
- Group cards on the Tickets and Pull Requests tabs now brighten with a full-accent rail on hover, and the spacing between groups was increased for clearer separation.
- Tickets tab content now starts below the Refresh button row instead of crowding it.

## [1.27.4] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Tickets tab now reliably detects and loads Jira issues. Four bugs fixed: (1) `unwrapMcpResponse` only matched object-shaped Go map values but the Atlassian resources endpoint returns an array; (2) server health check required `connected === true`, which is unstable for HTTP-backed servers; (3) no retry on detection failures caused startup races to block for the full 3-minute poll interval; (4) `extractIssues` only looked for a `"text":"<escaped JSON>"` wrapper but the search endpoint now returns issues JSON directly in the Go map text field.

## [1.27.3] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Dismissed workspace cards whose cmux workspace has been closed are now reaped on the next poll, instead of lingering forever in the Dismissed list. Previously the cleanup pass only removed active cards, so a dismissed card for a gone workspace couldn't be cleared and reappeared after the optimistic "close" window expired.

## [1.27.2] - 2026-06-18

### Removed

- Removed the non-functional Approve/Deny buttons from permission cards. They sent `y`/`n` keystrokes that don't match Claude Code's numbered permission menu, so clicking them did nothing. Click the card to jump to the workspace and answer the prompt in the terminal.

## [1.27.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Clicking the header update button now shows a sticky "Updating…" indicator that persists through polling cycles until the page reloads on the new version, instead of the progress state being clobbered by the next broadcast.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI that runs version-check and tests on every PR to master

## [1.26.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- In-app update no longer leaves `package-lock.json` dirty, so updates stop requiring a manual `git checkout package-lock.json` first. The update now runs `npm ci` (which never rewrites the lockfile) instead of `npm install`, `package-lock.json`'s version is synced with `package.json`, and `version-check` fails if the two drift.

### Changed

- Document `npm version --no-git-tag-version` as the correct way to bump versions (keeps `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in sync); hand-editing `package.json` is what caused the lockfile drift.

## [1.26.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Dangerous session refresh no longer falls back to `--continue` when no session UUID is found. A workspace with no prior session now launches a fresh `claude` process instead of incorrectly resuming an unrelated session.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Shift+click on refresh buttons (per-session and Refresh All) relaunches sessions with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Refresh affordances turn red while Shift is held as a visual warning.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Shift+click on any "New Session" button launches a session with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Buttons turn red while Shift is held as a visual warning.

## [1.23.4] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Replace fixed 1-second sleep before `/reload-plugins` with a screen-stability poll so the command is sent only once the terminal output has settled after session resume

## [1.23.3] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Auto-reload the page after pulling an update so new frontend code takes effect immediately

## [1.23.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Recent directories now show relative timestamps (e.g., "3h ago", "2d ago") indicating when they were last active

### Changed

- `timeAgo` helper now scales through days and weeks instead of capping at hours

## [1.23.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Refresh now sends `/reload-plugins` after resuming a session, ensuring updated plugins are picked up

## [1.23.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Default `defaultDirectory` is now `~/workspace` instead of home directory — avoids Claude Code trust prompts for new sessions
- Falls back to home directory if the configured path doesn't exist

## [1.22.2] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Removed accordion chevron, `(0)` count badge, and empty collapsible container from recent directory groups — they now render as flat labels with hover-revealed action buttons

## [1.22.1] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Replaced `maxVisibleGroups` config option with `maxRecentGroups` (default 4) — directly caps how many recently-used empty groups are shown, independent of active group count

## [1.22.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Recent workspace groups: directories that had active sessions remain visible (dimmed, collapsed) after sessions close, keeping "New Session" and "New Terminal" buttons accessible
- `maxVisibleGroups` config option (default 8) to control how many total workspace groups are displayed
- `showRecentGroups` config option (default true) to toggle recent group display on/off

## [1.21.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- cmux version compatibility indicator: orange warning pill in header when installed cmux version is outside the supported range (too old or too new)
- Clicking the pill automatically downloads, mounts, and installs the recommended cmux version
- Settings panel now shows detected cmux version alongside the supported range

## [1.20.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- New workspaces now receive keyboard focus immediately via cmux `--focus` flag

## [1.20.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Auto-start hook no longer depends on `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` env var (not set in cmux 0.64.10+); detects cmux via `__CFBundleIdentifier` with fallback to `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` for older versions
- Uninstall script now removes the full hook block instead of only 5 lines

## [1.20.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Refresh button no longer overlaps the edit workspace title button on cards

## [1.20.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Session refresh: exit and resume Claude Code sessions to pick up plugin updates without losing conversation context
- `POST /api/refresh-session` endpoint for refreshing a single session (async exit -> capture session ID -> resume)
- `POST /api/refresh-all` endpoint for refreshing all Claude Code sessions concurrently
- Per-card refresh button on Claude Code session cards (hidden for terminal workspaces)
- Toolbar "Refresh All" button in the Workspaces tab
- Spinner feedback on refresh buttons while in-flight, toast notifications on error or completion

## [1.19.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Plugin config editor in the Settings panel — auto-discovers Claude Code plugins with `config.json` files and provides a raw JSON editor for viewing/editing user overrides
- `GET /api/plugins` endpoint for listing configurable plugins with refresh support
- `GET /api/plugins/:id/config` endpoint returning bundled defaults, user override, and resolved config
- `POST /api/plugins/:id/config` endpoint for writing user config overrides
- `DELETE /api/plugins/:id/config` endpoint for resetting to bundled defaults

## [1.18.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Dismissed sessions no longer reappear when cmux rotates notification IDs — dismiss state now carries forward to the new ID unless the session escalates to a category requiring attention (e.g. running → permission)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Schema-driven config editing modal — click "Edit" in settings to modify all config fields in a form
- Toast notification system for confirming actions (config save, etc.)
- `GET /api/config/schema` endpoint exposing config schema, raw values, and resolved values
- `POST /api/config` endpoint for writing full config.json with auto-restart

### Removed

- Dedicated `POST /api/config/max-sessions` endpoint (superseded by `POST /api/config`)
- Max sessions toggle in settings panel (now part of the config modal form)

## [1.17.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- `categorizeNotification` now falls back to body text parsing when cmux subtitle is empty (cmux 0.64.3 moved notification info from subtitle to body)
- `listAgentWorkspaceIds` now detects Claude Code workspaces by title prefix (✳/⠂/⠐) when cmux workspace tags are empty (cmux 0.64.3 stopped setting process tags)

## [1.17.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Configurable `maxSessions` limit (null = unlimited, number = hard cap) — disables new session/terminal buttons and shows a toast when active workspace count reaches the limit
- Server-side enforcement via 429 on `/api/new-workspace` and `/api/agent-workspace`
- Max Sessions toggle in the settings panel for runtime changes without editing config.json

## [1.16.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Confirmation modal when upgrading from a non-master branch — asks to switch to master instead of showing an error

## [1.15.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Configurable `defaultDirectory` for "New Session" and "New Terminal" toolbar buttons — defaults to home directory, set in config.json to always open in a specific location
- "Edit" button in the settings panel opens a Claude session pre-loaded with the current config and a prompt to walk through changes

## [1.14.7] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Workspaces no longer appear in both the active and Dismissed sections after chatting with a dismissed session — dismissed entries are now restored to active when their workspace produces fresh activity, instead of ghosting under a stale id

## [1.14.6] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- "Assigned to me" filter on Reviews sub-tab now defaults to on

## [1.14.5] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed server crash after in-place update — missing `return` in `/api/update` success path caused headers to be written twice

## [1.14.4] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Eliminated spurious scrollbars on Workspaces tab caused by toolbar buttons overflowing the container

## [1.14.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Version pill now refreshes immediately on reconnect instead of racing with a fetch before the server is up
- Deduplicated changelog entries from overlapping PR merges

## [1.14.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Server now restarts after in-place update so the new version and code take effect immediately
- Fixed settings restart button — `process.exit(0)` killed the server permanently since `--watch` only restarts on file changes, not process exit. Both restart and update now touch `src/server.js` to trigger `--watch`

## [1.14.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate "Agent Triage Dashboard Host" workspaces — `close-workspace` was called with `--name` (unsupported), so stale workspaces were never cleaned up
- Autostart now uses `find-window` for exact title matching and closes all stale duplicates before creating a new workspace

## [1.14.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Auto-update notification: checks `origin/master` every 30 minutes for newer versions
- Update indicator in header with "What's New" modal showing changelog diff
- In-place update button that runs `git pull` + `npm install` (server auto-restarts via `--watch`)
- `POST /api/check-update` endpoint for manual refresh
- `POST /api/update` endpoint with dirty-tree safety check

## [1.13.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Claude sessions are now detected via cmux process tags instead of notification history, fixing workspaces showing as "terminal" after dashboard restart
- Workspaces correctly revert to "terminal" when Claude exits

## [1.13.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- New Session and New Terminal buttons now only appear on group headers (on hover), not on individual cards

## [1.13.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Dismissed cards now show a "close" button alongside "restore" so workspaces can be closed directly

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- New Session and New Terminal buttons in the toolbar, per-group headers, and per-card actions
- Session buttons launch Claude Code in the target directory; terminal buttons open a plain shell
- CSS tooltips (`data-tip`) for instant hover labels on all new buttons

## [1.12.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Workspace group collapse/expand state is now preserved across polling cycles

## [1.12.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- PRs from archived repositories are now silently excluded from the Mine and Reviews tabs — archived repos are read-only and can never be acted on

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- PR repo groups are now collapsible — click any repo header to fold it. Collapsed state persists across poll cycles and is tracked per sub-tab.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Settings panel with live server logs, resolved config display, and restart button
- Backdrop overlays on all drawers/panels — click outside or press Escape to close

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Refresh button on Loops, Pulls, and Tickets tabs to trigger an immediate poll
- Button shows inline status feedback (green/red)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- "Assigned to me" toggle button on the Reviews tab — filters to PRs where you are a direct, named reviewer rather than a team member

## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Jira detection now retries on each poll instead of failing permanently at startup
- Ticket fetch errors (rate limits, timeouts) shown in the tab instead of "No assigned tickets"
- Tab status (hints, availability) streams via WebSocket for real-time updates
- Poll errors show friendly one-line messages instead of raw mcpproxy stderr

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Replaced N+1 GitHub API calls with single GraphQL query per PR section (authored + review-requested)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- All optional tabs (Loops, Pulls, Tickets) are now enabled by default with auto-detection; missing dependencies show a setup hint instead of hiding the tab
- Jira tickets are zero-config: auto-detected at startup when a Jira MCP server is available

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- `npm start` now runs the server with `node --watch`, so backend changes pulled from master take effect on the next file change without a manual restart. The redundant `npm run dev` script was removed.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Workspace groups on the Workspaces tab now sort alphabetically by directory and stay in that order — previously they reordered as item categories changed.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Clicking the version number in the header opens a modal displaying the project's changelog
- `GET /api/changelog` endpoint that serves `CHANGELOG.md` as plain text

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Per-row action drawer on Pull Requests and Tickets tabs — clicking the Claude icon opens a side drawer with item metadata and a vertical action menu (status, review, address comments, update description for PRs; investigate, start work for tickets)
- Skill-backed actions fall back to plain-language instructions when the relevant plugin or skill isn't installed

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Per-row Claude-icon button on Pull Requests and Tickets tabs that opens a new cmux workspace and launches Claude with the PR or ticket as initial context
- For PR rows, the new workspace opens in `~/workspace/<repo>` if cloned locally, falling back to `~/workspace` then `~`
- New workspaces are auto-selected and focused after creation

### Fixed

- Dismiss button on workspace cards no longer un-dismisses items on the next poll (`Queue.upsert` was unconditionally resetting `dismissed: false`)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `runCli` no longer passes `execFile`'s `timeout` option, which was sending SIGTERM to the cmux helper mid-write and causing it to crash with an unhandled `NSFileHandleOperationException` (SIGABRT). A JS-level timer rejects on slow invocations without killing the child process.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Author filter dropdown on the PR Reviews tab, auto-populated from review request authors
- Status filter dropdown on both Mine and Reviews PR tabs (open, draft, comments, approved)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- "Terminal" category for plain shell workspaces — dimmed gray cards with `>_` icon, sorted below running agents
- Notification history tracking to distinguish Claude Code sessions from plain terminals

### Fixed

- Workspace tab badge now only counts items needing attention (excludes running and terminal)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Auto-start shell hook now uses zsh `precmd` instead of running during shell init, fixing broken-pipe failures when cmux socket isn't ready yet
- Replaced env-var guard (`_AGENT_TRIAGE_CHECKED`) with file-based marker keyed to cmux socket birth time, so the hook reliably fires after cmux restarts
- Stale lockfile detection — autostart now checks if the lock holder PID is alive and reclaims dead locks
- Stale server cleanup — detects and kills orphaned servers from previous cmux sessions before starting a new one

### Changed

- Dashboard now runs in a dedicated cmux workspace ("Agent Triage Dashboard Host") instead of a background `nohup` process
- Autostart reads port from `config.json` instead of hardcoding 7777
- Monitor filters out the dashboard's own workspace from notification cards

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Auto-start via `bin/install.sh` shell hook (launches dashboard when cmux opens)
- `bin/uninstall.sh` to remove the shell hook
- Changelog guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- Dynamic version reading from package.json at runtime

### Fixed

- Race condition where multiple cmux shells could each create a Dashboard workspace

### Removed

- cmux `set-hook` based auto-start (hooks were stored but never fired by cmux)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-22

### Added

- Semver version check script (`npm run version-check`)
- CLAUDE.md with setup instructions and architecture reference

### Changed

- Right-aligned version display in header
- Simplified README auto-start instructions

### Fixed

- Loops detection reliability
- Socket RPC connection handling

## [1.0.0] - 2025-04-21

### Added

- HTTP + WebSocket server with polling data sources
- cmux workspace and notification monitoring
- Claude Loops plugin data integration
- GitHub PR fetching via `gh` CLI
- Jira ticket fetching via MCP
- In-memory notification queue with dismiss/restore
- Vanilla JS frontend dashboard (no build step)
- PWA support for full-screen installation
